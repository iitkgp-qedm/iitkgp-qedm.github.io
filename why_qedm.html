                    <h2>Course Overview</h2><br />
                    <div class="well lefted">
                        <br />
                        <p>Quality Engineering Design and Manufacturing is a relatively new dual degree course started by IIT Kharagpur in 2011.<br />
                            The main motto to start the course is to provide students with exposure to engineering design, manufacturing, and quality topics related to mechanical products like automotive systems or electrical products like embedded systems.<br />
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <hr /><h2>How does the course work?</h2><br />
                    <div class="well lefted">
                        <br />
                        <p>After the first year, the students will be divided into 2 verticals - Industrial Electronics Vertical and Mechanical Engineering Vertical. In case you donâ€™t know, all first-year students at IIT KGP study the common courses only. Department specific courses are offered from the second year onwards.
                            <br /><br />Irrespective of the vertical a student chooses, she is provided with a strong foundation in design, manufacturing, analytics, supply chain, and management by the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department courses.
                            <br /><br />As this course is offered to only 16 students, most of the courses will be conducted along with the other departments' students.
                            <br>Being an interdisciplinary program offered collectively by three departments, studentes from both the verticals will be having classes with the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department, which is our main department.
                            <br />In addition, the Mechanical Vertical students will have classes with the students of Mechanical Engineering Department. Similarly, Industrial Electronics Vertical students will have classes with the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Departments' students.

                        <ul>
                            <li>We are the only branch in IIT KGP to be provided with 2 internships - a compulsory 2-month internship at the end of the 3rd year and a compulsory 6-month internship during the 8th semester. This provides the students with hands-on industrial experience in the fields of their interest.</li>
                            <li>The internship of 6 months' duration during the 8th semester provides students with great opportunities to grab pre-placement offers. (Many of our seniors have previously grabbed such offers)</li>
                            <li>Interdisciplinary courses offered by a variety of departments - owing to our flexible curriculum, students can choose to study some courses from a variety of departments - Computer Science and Engineering, Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering, Vinod Gupta School of Management, Rajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepreneurship, etc. The department gives you a free choice to choose your electives from any department or centre at IIT Kharagpur.</li>
                            <li>All the important core courses and labs which are given to the Electrical Engineering Department students are added in the curricula of the Industrial Electronics Vertical students. The same is the case for Mechanical Vertical students.</li>
